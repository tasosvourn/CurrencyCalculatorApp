# CurrencyCalculatorApp

CurrencyCalculatorApp is a simple calculator and currency converter application.
The user can build an expression with the four main operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
and convert the result to another currency by selecting the target currency from a list. The default currency is EUR,
but the user can change that too.

The project uses the Expression Builder library by [objecthunter.net](https://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/index.html).
